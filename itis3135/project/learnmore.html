            Objective-C is more than just a programming language—it's a gateway
            into a unique way of thinking about software design and interaction.
            Rooted in the principles of object-oriented programming, Objective-C
            encourages developers to build modular, reusable code while
            embracing the dynamic nature of runtime messaging. Its integration
            with Apple’s rich ecosystem of frameworks, like Cocoa and Cocoa
            Touch, means that writing in Objective-C is not just about
            syntax—it's about engaging with a powerful development environment
            that enables expressive, efficient, and elegant solutions. The
            language’s distinctive syntax and flexibility promote a mindset that
            values adaptability and deep system-level understanding. For many
            developers, Objective-C becomes not just a tool, but a philosophy of
            crafting user-centric, innovative applications that push the
            boundaries of what software can do.

            Objective-C has a rich and fascinating history that dates back to
            the early 1980s. It was created by Brad Cox and Tom Love, two
            software engineers who wanted to combine the power and performance
            of the C programming language with the elegance and flexibility of
            object-oriented programming. Inspired by Smalltalk's messaging
            system, they designed Objective-C to allow C programs to use objects
            and message-passing, giving rise to a new way of structuring code.
            Brad Cox, in particular, envisioned software as reusable components,
            which he called “software-ICs,” much like integrated circuits in
            hardware. This vision deeply influenced the development of
            Objective-C as a modular and scalable language.

        <p>
          In 1988, NeXT Inc., a company founded by Steve Jobs after he left
          Apple, licensed Objective-C to use in their own development
          environment. It became the cornerstone of NeXTSTEP, an operating
          system that would later evolve into macOS and iOS. Objective-C gained
          significant traction when Apple acquired NeXT in 1996, bringing
          Jobs—and Objective-C—back to Apple. From there, Objective-C became the
          primary programming language for Apple's software ecosystem for over a
          decade, powering iconic applications and systems across macOS and iOS.
          Its influence is deeply embedded in Apple’s developer culture, forming
          the foundation upon which many modern Apple technologies, including
          Swift, were built. The language’s legacy endures not only in the code
          that still runs today but also in the principles and frameworks that
          continue to shape software development on Apple platforms.
