          <h4>Set Up Your Development Environment</h4>
          <p>To start learning Objective-C, the first step is setting up the right tools on a Mac, as Objective-C is closely integrated with Apple’s ecosystem. Install Xcode, Apple’s free official IDE, from the Mac App Store. Xcode provides everything you need to develop in Objective-C, including a code editor, graphical interface builder, debugger, and essential frameworks like Foundation and Cocoa. Once installed, create a macOS command-line tool project using Objective-C to begin experimenting with the language. Spend time getting comfortable with the IDE, practice running and debugging simple programs, and explore the built-in documentation to better understand Apple’s development environment and resources.</p>

          <h4>Learn Objective-C Syntax and Core Concepts</h4>
          <p>After setting up your environment, dive into the core syntax and foundational concepts of Objective-C. Begin with variables, data types, loops, and conditionals—then gradually move into object-oriented programming features like classes, methods, inheritance, and message passing. One of Objective-C’s unique features is its message syntax, which is inspired by Smalltalk. For instance, calling a method looks like [myObject doSomething] rather than the dot notation used in languages like Java or C#. Learning this syntax will help you understand how Objective-C handles dynamic method resolution and runtime behavior. Resources like Apple’s Objective-C Programming Guide, RayWenderlich.com, and even open-source code on GitHub can help reinforce your understanding with practical examples.</p>

          <h4>Build Small Projects & Explore Apple Frameworks</h4>
          <p>To truly grasp Objective-C, start applying what you’ve learned by building small, focused projects. Begin with simple command-line applications, then move on to creating basic macOS or iOS apps using Cocoa (macOS) or Cocoa Touch (iOS) frameworks. Try building things like a to-do list, a calculator, or a basic game using SpriteKit. These projects will teach you how Objective-C interacts with Apple’s APIs and how to structure your code within the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. As you become more confident, explore more advanced topics like memory management (retain/release and ARC), delegates, categories, and protocols. Building hands-on projects will not only reinforce your skills but also give you a practical feel for Objective-C's power within real-world application development.</p>
