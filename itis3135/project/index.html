            Objective-C opens the creative mind in software development by
            blending the power of C with the flexibility of object-oriented
            programming, encouraging developers to think more dynamically and
            modularly. Its unique messaging syntax, influenced by Smalltalk,
            challenges conventional programming structures and invites a deeper
            understanding of how objects interact at runtime. This dynamic
            nature allows developers to design highly customizable, responsive
            applications, especially within the Apple ecosystem. By promoting
            modular thinking and runtime flexibility, Objective-C encourages
            problem-solving that goes beyond rigid structures, making room for
            more imaginative, elegant solutions in app architecture, user
            experience, and feature implementation.

            Objective-C continues to play an important role in the development
            of popular video games, particularly within the iOS and macOS
            platforms. While many modern game engines like Unity and Unreal use
            C# or C++, Objective-C is still widely used for building game
            infrastructure, integrating with Appleâ€™s native APIs, and optimizing
            performance on Apple devices. Games that rely on Apple-specific
            technologies such as SpriteKit, SceneKit, and Metal often use
            Objective-C for core game logic, rendering, and user interface
            design. Popular mobile games, including early versions of titles
            like Crossy Road, Fruit Ninja, and Angry Birds, utilized Objective-C
            to take full advantage of iOS capabilities. Its dynamic runtime and
            ability to seamlessly interact with Apple frameworks make
            Objective-C a valuable tool for developers who want fine control
            over performance and system-level features, fostering creativity in
            crafting responsive, polished gaming experiences.
